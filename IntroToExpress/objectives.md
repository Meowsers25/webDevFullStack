A library, you have control....you call the functionality

A framework, the framework calls you.(less control) Framework provides the scaffolding(the setup work)

Express is a web development framework.

Why Express? It is the most popular Node framework(large community). Express is a lightwweight framework.
    This means that there are a lot of blanks to fill. The user understands how the framework works, as opposed
    to a heavyweight framework(Rails) where the user doesnt have much to fill in, but also, is harder
    to understand under the hood.
